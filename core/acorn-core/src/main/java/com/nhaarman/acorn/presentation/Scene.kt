/**
 * A Scene is a destination in the application the user can navigate to.
 *
 * Scenes are the boundary between your application logic and the UI that is
 * displayed to the user.
 *
 * The lifecycle of a Scene is very simple:
 *
 *  - 'inactive' : The Scene is dormant, waiting to become active or to
 *                 be destroyed.
 *  - 'active'   : The Scene is active.
 *  - 'destroyed': The Scene is destroyed and will not become active anymore.
 *
 * On top of that, the user interface can attach to and detach itself from this
 * Scene via the [attach] and [detach] methods, providing interaction with
 * the user. It is therefore possible that the Scene is active without having
 * a user interface attached.
 *
 * Scenes may implement [SaveableScene] to indicate that their instance state
 * can be saved. When this is the case, [SaveableScene.saveInstanceState] will
 * be called at the appropriate time.
 *
 * @param V The type of the view to display the Scene, representing the
 *          user interface.
