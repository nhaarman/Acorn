/**
 * An interface that describes a flow through the application.
 *
 * The Navigator is a class that takes care of navigating the user through an
 * application by showing a sequence of Scenes.
 * Interested parties may subscribe a listener using [addNavigatorEventsListener], through which
 * Scene changes will be published.
 *
 * Navigators are responsible for handling the lifecycles of the Scenes they
 * manage. To be able to do this, the Navigator has a very simple lifecycle as
 * well:
 *
 *  - `inactive` : The Navigator is currently idle and will not emit any changes
 *                 in Scenery.
 *  - `active`   : The Navigator is currently active and will notify interested
 *                 parties of changes in Scenes.
 *  - `destroyed`: The Navigator has been destroyed and will not become active
 *                 anymore.
 *
 * Navigator instance start in the `inactive` state and can switch between
 * `inactive` and `active` an infinite amount of times.
 * Once a Navigator has been destroyed, it must be considered as dead, and any
 * further interactions with it will be ignored.
 *
 * Navigators that are not `active` must never have Scenes in their `active`
 * state.
 *
 * Navigators may implement [SaveableNavigator] to indicate that their instance state
 * can be saved. When this is the case, [SaveableNavigator.saveInstanceState] will
 * be called at the appropriate time.
